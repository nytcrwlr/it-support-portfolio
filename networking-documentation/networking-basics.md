## ‚úÖ Definitions

**LAN (Local Area Network):**
A network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, or office building. LANs typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi.

**WAN (Wide Area Network):**
A network that spans a large geographic area, often composed of multiple LANs. The internet is the largest WAN.

**IP (Internet Protocol) Address:**
A unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It enables devices to communicate with each other over the internet or local networks.

**Subnet:**
A smaller, segmented part of a larger network. Subnetting improves network efficiency and security by dividing networks into manageable sections.

**Gateway:**
A device, usually a router, that acts as a bridge between two networks. It routes traffic from a local network to other networks, including the internet.

## üß† OSI Model (7 Layers Explained)
1. **Physical Layer** ‚Äì Deals with physical connections (cables, switches).
2. **Data Link Layer** ‚Äì Responsible for node-to-node data transfer (MAC addresses).
3. **Network Layer** ‚Äì Handles routing and IP addressing (IP addresses).
4. **Transport Layer** ‚Äì Ensures reliable data transfer (TCP/UDP).
5. **Session Layer** ‚Äì Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation Layer** ‚Äì Translates and encrypts data.
7. **Application Layer** ‚Äì Closest to the user; provides network services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).

## üìå Example: IP Address with Subnet Mask
**IP Address:** 192.168.1.10  
**Subnet Mask:** 255.255.255.0  
This configuration allows communication within the 192.168.1.0 network.

## üìù Reflection
Today I learned the fundamentals of networking, including how devices connect and communicate using IP addresses within LANs and WANs. I now understand how subnetting organizes networks and how gateways connect local networks to the internet. The OSI model provided a structured way to understand how data travels through different layers of a network.
