1️⃣ Motherboard
📌 Description:
The motherboard is the main circuit board of the computer. It connects and allows communication between all other components.

📌 Functions:
    Houses the CPU, RAM, Storage, and Expansion Slots.
    Provides power and data pathways between components.
    Contains chipsets and firmware (BIOS/UEFI).
📌 Common Brands: ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock.

2️⃣ Processor (CPU - Central Processing Unit)
📌 Description:
The CPU (processor) is the brain of the computer. It processes instructions and performs calculations.

📌 Functions:
    Executes instructions from programs.
    Handles arithmetic and logical operations.
    Manages data transfer between components.
📌 Common Brands: Intel (Core i3, i5, i7, i9), AMD (Ryzen 3, 5, 7, 9).

3️⃣ Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)
📌 Description:
RAM is the temporary memory where the CPU stores data it is actively using.

📌 Functions:
    Speeds up program execution.
    Stores temporary data while the PC is running.
    Provides fast access to frequently used information.

📌 Common Types: DDR3, DDR4, DDR5.
📌 Sizes: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, etc.

4️⃣ Storage Devices (HDD & SSD)
📌 Description:
Storage devices hold the operating system, software, and user files.

📌 Types:
✅ HDD (Hard Disk Drive) – Mechanical storage, slower, larger capacity (500GB – 10TB).
✅ SSD (Solid State Drive) – Faster, no moving parts, more durable (128GB – 4TB).

📌 Functions:
    Boots the operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS).
    Stores applications and user files.
    Caches frequently accessed data (SSDs).
📌 Common Brands: Seagate, Western Digital, Samsung, Crucial.

5️⃣ Power Supply Unit (PSU)
📌 Description:
The Power Supply Unit (PSU) converts AC power from the wall into DC power used by PC components.

📌 Functions:
    Powers motherboard, CPU, GPU, and peripherals.
    Regulates voltage and prevents electrical damage.

📌 Common Wattages: 450W, 550W, 750W, 1000W+.
📌 Common Brands: Corsair, EVGA, Thermaltake.

6️⃣ Graphics Card (GPU - Graphics Processing Unit) [Optional]
📌 Description:
A Graphics Card (GPU) is used for rendering images, videos, and gaming graphics.
📌 Functions:
    Processes graphics for gaming, video editing, and 3D modeling.
    Accelerates AI and machine learning tasks.
📌 Common Brands: NVIDIA (RTX 3060, RTX 4090), AMD (RX 6600, RX 7900).

7️⃣ Cooling System (Fans, Heat Sinks, Liquid Cooling)
📌 Description:
Cooling systems prevent overheating by dissipating heat from components.
📌 Types:
✅ Air Cooling – Fans and heat sinks.
✅ Liquid Cooling – Radiators and water blocks.

📌 Functions:
    Maintains safe operating temperatures.
    Prevents CPU/GPU throttling due to heat.
📌 Common Brands: Noctua, Corsair, NZXT.

8️⃣ Computer Case (Chassis)
📌 Description:
The chassis (case) houses and protects all internal components.

📌 Functions:
    Provides airflow and cooling.
    Holds the motherboard, PSU, and drives.

📌 Types:
✅ Full Tower – Large, for gaming and workstation builds.
✅ Mid Tower – Most common size.
✅ Mini ITX – Small form factor.
📌 Common Brands: NZXT, Cooler Master, Fractal Design.

9️⃣ Peripherals (Input & Output Devices)
📌 Input Devices (User Controls the PC)
✅ Keyboard – For typing commands.
✅ Mouse – Controls on-screen movement.
✅ Webcam & Microphone – For video calls.

📌 Output Devices (PC Displays Data to User)
✅ Monitor – Displays images and videos.
✅ Speakers & Headphones – Audio output.
✅ Printers & Scanners – For documents.

📌 Common Brands: Logitech, Razer, Corsair, Dell, HP.
